NOTE: This method can be used for e-mail experiments only, not for AMT experiments.

1) Open consentform.html file with any text editor. I personally recommend Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2) MAKE SURE TO MODIFY LINES 25-42, this lines contain the consent form text.
3) MAKE SURE TO MODIFY LINE 9 to point to the experiment URL.
4) Place modified consentform.html file and two files (vu-consentform.css,mobile-detect.min.js) in a web server.
  - You may try using GitHub pages.
5) Now, you can use the link to the "consentform.html" uploaded on the web server.
6) Ask Oakyoon, if you are not sure what to do.
